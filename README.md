# Airfares

The purpose of this project is to analyze airline fares collected in the 90s when the airline industry was deregulated. The inspiration behind choosing this data was the curiosity of learning about airfares and what factors play a role in price determination. Since The Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, The United States federal law deregulated the airline industry, removing the federal government control over such areas as fares, routes, and market entry of new airlines. Therefore, it is now even more interesting to look into what drives pricing of certain trips.
